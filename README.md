# Mining Multimodal Knowledge from Chemistry Literature for Self-Learning Agents

This repository contains the code and data for the paper "Mining Multimodal Knowledge from Chemistry Literature for Self-Learning Agent". All the files are organized within the `src` folder, which has the following structure:

## Folder Structure

- **textie**: Contains model weights (will be added in the future) for text-based knowledge extraction and the implementation of AutoRescue.
- **imageie**: Includes model weights for MolYOLODetect and the implementation of MolRuleCoref.
- **alignment**: Provides the code for dataset generation, the generated datasets, and testing methods.
- **demo**: Contains the knowledge graph data constructed in this paper and Python scripts for building the knowledge graph.
